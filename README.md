I have started the "**CS50 Introduction to programming with python**", and this folder contains the project of WEEK0 projects 
**PROJECT#1: indoor**
In a file called indoor.py, there is a program in Python that prompts the user for input and then outputs that same input in lowercase.
Punctuation and whitespace are outputted unchanged. 
**Usage** : Function of lower() was used 

**PROJECT#2: playback**
In a file called playback.py, there is a program in Python that prompts the user for input and then outputs that same input, replacing each space with ... (i.e., three periods).
**Usage** : Function of replace("old str, "new str") was used 

**PROJECT#3: faces**
In a file called faces.py, there is a function called convert that accepts a str as input and returns that same input with any :) converted to üôÇ 
and any :( converted to üôÅ. All other is returned unchanged.Then, in that same file, there a function called main that prompts the user for input,
calls convert on that input, and prints the result. 
**Usage** : Function of replace("old str, "new str") was used 

**PROJECT#4: einstein**
In a file called einstein.py, there is a program in Python that prompts the user for mass as an integer (in kilograms) and then outputs the equivalent number
of Joules as an integer. Assume that the user will input an integer.
**Usage** : Function of int("str") was used 

**PROJECT#5:tip**
In this project , i have desgined the tip calculator which takes total bill amount and percentage of tip on bill in string form and then convert it into the float and calculated the 
amount of tip and returned it to the user. Assume that the user will input values in the expected formats such as for the bill amount $ x.xx and for tip as xx%.
**Usage** : Function of float("str") was used
